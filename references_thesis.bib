  abstract = {We develop a theory of the extrinsic contributions to the ferromagnetic
	resonance linewidth and frequency shift of ultrathin films. The basic
	mechanism is two magnon scattering by defects at surfaces and interfaces.
	In the presence of dipolar couplings between spins in the film, one
	realizes short wavelength spin waves degenerate with the ferromagnetic
	resonance (FMR) mode, provided the magnetization is parallel to the
	film surfaces. Defects on the surface or interface thus scatter the
	FMR mode into such short wavelength spin waves, producing a dephasing
	contribution to the linewidth, and a frequency shift of the resonance
	field. The mechanism described here is inoperative when the magnetization
	is perpendicular to the film.},

  review = {Magnetic heterostructures constitute an important field in magnetism
	and nanotechnology, which has developed over the past fifteen years
	due to important advances in epitaxial- growth techniques and lithographic
	processes. Magnetic heterostructures combine different physical properties
	which do not exist in nature. Examples are semiconductors/ferromagnets,
	superconductors/ferromagnets, and ferromagnets/antiferromagnets.
	These combinations display rich and novel physical properties different
	from those that exit in any single one of them. Interlayer exchange
	coupling, exchange bias, proximity effects, giant magneto-resistance,
	tunneling magneto-resistance, spininjection and spintransport are
	examples of new physical phenomena that rely on the combination of
	different materials layers. Since the literature on magnetic heterostructures
	is widely spread and highly specialized, the situation calls for
	a book that provides an overview of the basics and the state of the
	art of magnetic heterostructures. These contributions by renowned
	experts and leading scientists in the field provide an introduction
	for the young researcher, as well as an expert overview on the present
	status and future challenges.},

  review = {Magnetic materials can support propagating waves of magnetization;
	since these are oscillations in the magnetostatic properties of the
	material, they are called magnetostatic waves (sometimes magnons
	or magnetic polarons ). Under the proper circumstances these waves
	can exhibit, either dispersive or nondispersive, isotropic or anisotropic
	propagation, nonreciprocity, frequency-selective nonlinearities,
	soliton propagation, and chaotic behavior. This rich variety of behavior
	has led to a number of proposed applications in microwave and optical
	signal processing. This book begins by introducing magnetism and
	discusses magnetic properties of materials, magnetic moments of atoms
	and ions, and the elements important to magnetism. It then goes on
	to cover magnetic susceptibilities, electromagnetic waves in anisotropic
	dispersive media, magnetostatic modes, and propagation characteristics
	and excitation of magnetostatic waves among other topics. There are
	problems at the end of each chapter, many of which serve to expand
	or explain the material in the text. The bibliographies for each
	chapter give an entry to the research literature. Spin Waves: Theory
	and Applications serves not only as an introduction to an active
	area of research, but also as a reference for workers in the field.},
